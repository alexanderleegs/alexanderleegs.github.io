The AI developed was meant to be able to distinguish between instances of known classes which it had been trained on, and instances of unknown classes which had little similarity to the currently known classes it was trained on. The system would then handle each case appropriately. The framework designed allowed for the system to use interchangeable modules for each of its components. During the process of this internship, I investigated uncertainty modelling in AI with Bayesian neural networks and case-based reasoning.\",\n        caption: \"Intern\",\n        date: \"May \\'19 - Aug \\'19\",\n        short: \"Cognitive System Framework\"\n      },\n      {\n        name: 'dso1',\n        img: \"/images/dso.png\",\n        text: \"My internship at DSO National Laboratories for the summer was one of my first experiences working on AI.
